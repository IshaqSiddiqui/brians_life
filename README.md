IT Brian and his IAM journey

Context: Brian in IT is unhappy. His new job is boring, unnecessarily time 
consuming and most frustratingly of all - very unmodern. 

His job consists of manual onboarding and offboarding - and he’s been 
given spreadsheets to keep track of the existing employee database. 

He also has to maintain a dated security system to ensure the company 
stays safe. 

Lucky for him, the owner of this organisation is his doting uncle. And 
Brian has the ability to sweet talk his uncle into anything. 

Anything. 

It would be safe to say that Brian did not get this job based on merit. 

He’s now on a journey to explore less boring ways to do his job. 

And he’s sure whatever fancy gizmos he needs, his uncle will provide.
